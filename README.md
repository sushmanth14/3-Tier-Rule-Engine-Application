# 3-Tier-Rule-Engine-Application
A 3-tier rule engine application designed to determine user eligibility based on various attributes like age, department, income, and spend. This application utilizes an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules, allowing for dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules.
Features
- Dynamic Rule Creation: Create rules from strings and represent them as an AST.
- Rule Combination: Combine multiple rules into a single AST for efficient evaluation.
- Evaluation: Evaluate rules against user attributes to determine eligibility.
- Error Handling: Handle invalid rule strings and data formats gracefully.
- Attribute Validation: Ensure attributes are part of a defined catalog.
- Modification Capabilities: Modify existing rules dynamically.
- User -Defined Functions: Extend the rule language to support advanced conditions (future scope).
